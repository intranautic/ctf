looking at runtime dumps the vcpu contains the current state of the vcpu
exported the guest program from the idb and from gdb (static/dynamic)
runtime more useful, we can introspect layout of program. keep in mind
that this is running in real mode

relevant offsets:
stack: 0x3000
heap:  0x4000

ah ok IVT should be on guest-phys 0x00 page but since interaction via port i/o
and no peripheral emulation no external intr.
