uaf in delete_user(), ptr in magic_users global array is not zeroed.
struct MagicUser is 140 bytes including padded alignment, ends up in kmalloc-192
slab cache. cred_struct is also in kmalloc-192, so we can use our uaf to overwrite
creds during switch which is then comitted.

new, new
free a uaf in b, b top of freelist
switch to b in g ptr: allocs cred inside b
free b, top of freelist
alloc new user, user buffer can overwrite uids of cred.
write starts at cred struct magic, have to fake magic then just nulls for uids
