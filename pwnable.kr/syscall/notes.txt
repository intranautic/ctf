no kaslr, smep, smap
unbounded write from in->out, writes bytes regardless if not ascii
we have unlimited write of all bytes excluding range [a-z]
remote is running Linux 3.11.4 armv7l, no paging??
since no smep, we could use sys_upper to overwrite syscall table with
userspace function?
wtf ok we just need to overwrite syscall table and invoke syscalls im braindead..

commit_creds symbol last byte of addr falls within range 0x6c, so we can overwrite
the commit_creds-12 with nops with proper alignment since arm linux kernel v3 does
not have write protection on kernel .text.
