rootkit disabled write prot and hooks syscall table each of the hooks check if flag
is present in the path. we have uid/gid=0 on remote machine, we just need to bypass 
this check. removing itself from the module linked list? remote lsmod or
/proc/modules is not showing the lkm.

we can load our own kernel driver?  easy, go one level lower and just fucking
read manually via vfs api

build is a pain in the fucking ass, just patch the original kernel module on server
