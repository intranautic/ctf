two solutions using srop or ret2csu

we can use either technique to gain control of the registers, and from there overwrite
the lsb of the GOT entry for sym.sleep to call syscall gadget. use read import to write
'/bin/sh\x00' to .bss or .data, any writeable region of memory which has a known/fixed
address.

voila, execve to shell.
